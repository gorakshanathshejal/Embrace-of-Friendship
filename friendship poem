In the tapestry of life, a thread so fine,
Weaves bonds of friendship, so divine.
A treasure of hearts, forever aligned,
In the realm of friendship, we truly shine.

Through stormy skies and oceans wide,
Side by side, we stand with pride.
In the darkest nights, you're my guiding star,
With you, my friend, I've traveled far.

In laughter's embrace and tears we share,
Moments of joy and burdens we bear.
A friend's gentle touch, a soothing balm,
In your presence, I find a sense of calm.

In laughter's echo, in silent support,
Best friends understand, without a retort.
In secrets shared, and dreams set free,
You and me, best friends, an eternal decree.

On Independence Day, our spirits soar high,
A celebration of freedom, beneath the azure sky.
A day to honor the brave, who fought and stood strong,
For a nation united, where liberty belongs.
