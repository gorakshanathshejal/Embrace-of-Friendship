In the tapestry of life, a thread so fine,
Weaves bonds of friendship, so divine.
A treasure of hearts, forever aligned,
In the realm of friendship, we truly shine.

Through stormy skies and oceans wide,
Side by side, we stand with pride.
In the darkest nights, you're my guiding star,
With you, my friend, I've traveled far.

In laughter's embrace and tears we share,
Moments of joy and burdens we bear.
A friend's gentle touch, a soothing balm,
In your presence, I find a sense of calm.
